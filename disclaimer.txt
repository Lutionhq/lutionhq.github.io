* TERMS
- The program ("Equinox").
- The developers ("The EquinoxHQ Team").
- The service providers ("Roblox Corporation")

* PREAMBLE
Equinox is a runtime for Roblox on Linux that uses containerization.
It is a research project that aims to see how well an Android application can be integrated into a Linux desktop.

* MONETARY ASPECTS
Equinox generates no income for its developers. We do not charge any forms of payment for our program.
We do not accept any forms of donations. The developers might individually accept sponsorships and other donations,
but there are no official ways to donate to our collective.

* TAMPERING & SECURITY
Equinox is an open-source program. As such, it does not implement any protections to prevent the misuse of the Roblox platform.
However, it lets Roblox's anticheat ("Hyperion") run unrestricted in the container environment with no artificial limits imposed.
This means that Equinox facilitates no more or less potential for abuse of the Roblox platform than a standard Android device.
The program does not facilitate the distribution or execution of tools that tamper with Roblox ("cheats").

* COPYRIGHT
Equinox respects ALL copyrights and trademarks of Roblox Corporation and its affiliates. It does not illicitly distribute any copyrighted Roblox materials, intellectual properties, software or assets.

* LIABILITY & CONTACT
The Equinox team holds zero responsibility for any damage you incur by using the program.
The Equinox team is not affiliated with Roblox Corporation or its affiliates.
Any inquiries can be sent to the author of this document at his/her/their email address.
