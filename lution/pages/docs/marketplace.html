<h1>How to Add Your Mod/Theme to the Lution Marketplace</h1>

<h3>1. Fork this <a href="https://github.com/Lutionhq/Lution-Marketplace">Repo</a></h3>
<p>Click the Fork button at the top of the page to get started.</p>

<h3>2. Add your mod or theme</h3>
<p>• Put your mod zip file in: <code>Assets/Mods/Content</code></p>
<p>• Put your theme zip file in: <code>Assets/Theme/Content</code></p>
<p>• Drop your thumbnail file in: <code>Assets/thumbnails</code></p>

<h3>3. Drop a pull request</h3>
<p>Once you're done, open a pull request and add the Mods/Theme Request label.</p>
<p>You can open one here: <a href="https://github.com/Lutionhq/Lution-Marketplace/compare">Open a pull request</a></p>

<h3>4. What to do next</h3>
<p>
If you made the mod or just uploaded it to the marketplace, make sure to keep it updated.
You can use tools like <a href="https://github.com/TheKliko/klikos-modding-tool#">Killo's modding tool</a>
to help with that. (Not sponsored, trust me)
